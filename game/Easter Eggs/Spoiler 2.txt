You want to battle wits? see who's a better pacifist
I fought the caste system, but you still cannot touch this
Slumdog skillionaire, first name Messiah
Raps so hot I spit yoga fire
Everything you preach, I said it first
You should just jot down these words, plagiarize my whole verse
Leave your thoughts on the door like the real Martin Luther
I'm not thinking you shall overcome this Junior
I'm the King of civil rights from the city to suburbia
No shoes, no shirt, but I'm still gonna serve ya
Make you swallow your words so you can break the fast
Then thank God almighty, you can eat at last
I admire the way you broke the British power
But I have a dream that one day you'll take a shower
Like the H in your name, you ought to remain silent
Flatten your style like bread, Naan-violence
You would know about bread, Dr.Birmingham sandwich
Boycott those grits, sit in with some spinach
With protests and women, the same advice goes
Always stay away from the ho's
I've got so much street cred they write my name on the signs
I'd ring you for tech support, but I got a no bell prize
Nigga, we got more beef than one of your sacred cows
But I'm about to forgive you so hard right now
I am passively resisting the fact that you suck
I am celibate because I don't give a fuck
