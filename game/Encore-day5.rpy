    "I slowly open my eyes, expecting the same rush of pain to hit me like a freight train."
    "Unexpectedly, as I lay in bed waiting for the inevitable, I feel fine."
    "Aside from this feeling of dread..."
    "I peek over my shoulder to look at my alarm."
    "Well, I don't have to get up for about half an hour..."
    "But, maybe it's best I get ready early for once..."
    "This is going to be a long day..."
    "I slowly drag myself of bed, still wary that a sudden rush of pain could come at me at anytime, and prepare for the day."
