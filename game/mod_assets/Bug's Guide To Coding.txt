In this, I’ll layout how I want Day 2’s code so that production is more efficient.

Variations
———————————————————————————————
Anyways, you should have the scripts for all of the girls sole routes, I’ll go through and work out variations but PLEASE mark all of them with a note (ex of note: #variation: depends on <condition>), that way I won’t need to go through and search for all of them.
I’m sure you can figure out what a variation looks like, but in case, it’s any piece of dialogue or event that changes depending on the first 3 questions asked by the mod, or any other choices the player has made throughout. 
These include (but are not limited to):
	-References to Sayori’s confession outcome
	-References to who the player spent the festival with
	-References to previous days hangout scenes
	-References to previous days poem responses
	-References to previous days exclusive scenes

Script Structure
———————————————————————————————
For the script itself, I want you to go through and code all dialogue for said day’s core routes (as mentioned earlier, I’ll deal with variations). I request the dialogue is FIXED and FUNCTIONAL so that I don’t need to go through and search for errors in code (;-; pls Nico). 
I also request backgrounds be put into effect and that you mark where transitions must be added (ex: #bg transition needed here). Please do the same with any music choices, marking where music needs to added with notes (ex: #music needed here)
For the choices, you can code them in if you wish, but if you decide not to mark them all with (ex:#choice menu <what decision is being made>), the same goes for the affection_adding at the end of the day, mark it with a note (ex: #affection assignment here)
For expressions, you need not do these, I can handle that task

Etc.

If you code in anything else (like a new auto-script) or do decide to code in music, expressions, etc. then please INFORM ME
