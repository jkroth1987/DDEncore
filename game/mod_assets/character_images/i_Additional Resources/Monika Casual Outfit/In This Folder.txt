All I know about this casual outfit for Monika is that it was used in the Doki Doki Brand New Day mod. I don't know who drew it or whether it's cleared for use by anyone or was intended for just one mod. Still, having at least one casual outfit for Monika would be great, and I wanted to make this one at least available for testing. If you add it to your project, you can remove the placeholder "0.png" files currently in Monika's casual outfit folder.
