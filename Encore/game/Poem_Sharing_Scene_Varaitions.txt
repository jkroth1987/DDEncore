#Declined Sayori's Confession, Spent Weekend With Natsuki

#Spent Day 1 with Sayori

"It was relatively inspiring actually."
--------------------------------------------
#Add new text for this varaition

"Natsuki actually was the one who approached me, seemingly genuinely excited to read whatever I had made and to show me what she wrote."
"She, of course, gave some advice but it came off more as her just complimenting my work."
"But she really struggled to make eye contact with me, either out of guilt for being angry when I was around her today..."
"Or the fact that last Sunday was still on her mind..."
"Not that I can blame her."
"But I think that I got at least some insight into what she's going through right now."
"Natsuki's poem was in her trademark style of being short, sweet and to the point. It was about someone finding happiness by spending time with the person they loved the most, but was unsure if that person liked them back and how she was getting a lot of mixed signals."
"Sayori's reaction is about what I expected. She says that's it really good, and gives some encouragement, though, I could tell that she was really forcing a smile."
"I can't tell if it's her ‘rainclouds' acting up or she's still getting over the rejection..."
"I can definitely tell she was still emotionally conflicted when I read her poem. Well, I could definitely tell that she was speaking from experience."
"It was about about two friends, a boy and a girl, who were together for many years. When the girl finally confessed her feelings to the boy at his house, the boy hesitantly rejected her and walked back into the house, but oddly enough let the door open."
"Reading Sayori's poem really made me feel guilty about what happened last Sunday. I just hope we can put what happened behind us..."
"I was fortunately able to change the subject after we finished reading each other's poems, with our conversation shifting to about our school day and what homework we have."
"Even through our conversation, the events of last Sunday weighed heavy in the air."
"Despite Sayori's deep sighs and pained expressions, I can't help but notice how beautiful she looks in the sunlight."
"The smell of Cinnamon that radiates from her hair..."
"And the fact that we've been there for each other for practically forever, I feel like I let her down last Sunday.
"Maybe I made the wrong choice..."
"..."

"Yuri's poem was in her usual style of being deep and sophisticated, but it was unusually joyful for what she usually writes about."
"Through my best interpretation of her poem, it seemed like it was about someone finally feeling wanted."

"During our conversation we at times struggled to make eye contact with each other."
"Yuri and I never really got to spend much one on one time with each other, so it was a little awkward for both of us at first."
"But within the first few minutes we more less moved past it and got to know each other a little bit better."
"Yuri really is a deep and interesting person to be around."
"Not to mention, I think I've started taking a liking to her little quirks."
