#If You Hung Out With Sayori On Day 1 and Natsuki on Day 2


m "You wouldn't have been in this situation if you just avoided them!"
"Oh no... not this again..."
m "You never listen do you?"
m "When I told you to stay away from Sayori..."
m "I didn't mean switch to Natsuki!"
m "And you still somehow ended up making things worse for us by still sticking by with Sayori."
m "Well... at least you managed to damage some of her trust in you."
m "But thanks to your bumbling efforts, you have more or less restored that trust! You need to stay away from her like you did today!"
m "You really are making this needlessly difficult for us, aren't you?"
m "Let me help clarify something for you, [player]."
"Suddenly I see a silhouette approach me."
"The figure comes into my view... it's Natsuki."
m "Natsuki can never love you the same way I do."
