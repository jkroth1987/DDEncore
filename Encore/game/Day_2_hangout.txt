"But for her getting close to me like this isn't usual..."
"I mean, I don't mind being this close to Natsuki."
"But I'm afraid that someone's gonna catch us and immediately get the wrong idea..."
"I glance around the room to see Yuri reading her book, Sayori still spacing out and Monika working on something."
"I then turn back to Natsuki, meeting her gaze."

#New text below

"I spot her in her usual spot at the front of the room."
"I tepidly approach her as she seems to be absorbed into her book."
"However, she quickly spots me heading her way."
y "Hello, [player]!"
"She smiles warmly at me."
mc "Hey, Yuri! What's up?"
y "Oh, just reading some Portrait of Markov."
"Yuri shows me the cover of the book."
"There's an ominous-looking eye symbol on the front cover."
mc "Isn't that a horror novel?"
"Yuri pauses for a moment."
y "Y-yeah... are you not into that sort of thing?"
mc "I mean, like I said when I first joined, that can change."
"And the book cover definitely stands out to make it seem like its at least a halfway decent read."
mc "What's it about?"
y "It's about this girl in high school who moves in with her long-lost younger sister..."
y "But as soon as she does so, her life gets really strange."
mc "How so?"
y  "She gets targeted by these people who escaped from a human experiment prison..."
y "And while her life is in danger, she needs to desperately choose who to trust."
"Ah, it's one of those kinds of novels..."
"The kind that seems to have a normal story for the first few chapters and then has a messed up twist and everything goes to hell..."
"That reminds me of a story actually..."
y "It's a really great novel! It's one of my favorites!"
mc "Well, if that's the case, mind if I join you?"
"Yuri's face starts turning a bright shade of red."
y "Oh... I wouldn't want to pull you away from Sayori or anything like that!"
mc "Nah, you aren't, she's fine."
"Right?"
"I nervously glance over to Sayori who appears to be spacing out."
"Ah, she'll be fine for a few minutes..."
y "W-well... if you say so...."
"I take a seat right next to Yuri."
y "Ah...!"
mc "You alright?"
y "Y-yeah, I'm fine!"
y "It's just that... I'm not used to reading in the company of another person."
mc "Ah, well let me know if I end up distracting you or anything."
y "A-alright..."
y "Do you have the copy I gave you?"
mc "Ah, not on me."
mc "Sorry!"
y "N-no, it's fine... if you want..."
"Yuri's voice trails off as if she seems embarrassed to say what's on her mind."
mc "What is it?"
y "Well...it's a bit of a weird idea..."
mc "I won't judge you, I promise."
y "O-okay..."
y "Well..."
y "Do you both want to share the same copy?"
"I don't see how that's a weird idea..."
mc "Yeah, sure! It works for me."
y "O-okay..."
"Yuri puts the book between us."
y "It's kind of hard to see..."
"Yuri leans towards me and as she does I can feel her pressed up against me."
"This feels a little strange, but she's just trying to get a better view on the book...right?"
"It feels like my left arm is in the way, so instead I use my right hand to hold the book open."
mc "Ah, I guess that makes it kind of difficult to turn the page..."
y "Here..."
"Yuri takes her left arm and holds the left side of the book between her thumb and forefinger."
"I still don't know where to put my left arm though...."
"There really isn't a good spot for me to put it..."
"I would think about wrapping my arm around her, but that wouldn't be a good idea..."
"Ah, I'll just suffer through it..."
y "Ready to begin, [player]?"
mc "Yeah, let's get started!"
"Yuri manges a cheerful grin and we begin reading."
"..."
"After reading for a few minutes I see Yuri start to move around in her seat as if she were uncomfortable."
mc "Everything good, Yuri?"
y "Yeah, it's just that my posture isn't too good right now."
"Her ‘posture'?"
"My eyes can't help but glance at Yuri's..."
"Oh..."
"How did I miss that?"
"Yeah... I can see how that can be an issue for her...."
"And me."
mc "Maybe we should move to a better spot?"
y "I mean... if you're comfortable here I don't mind...."
mc "Yuri, I don't want you to be uncomfortable if sitting like this is going to make you uncomfortable."
mc "I really don't mind where we read as long as we're together."
"Oh..."
"Might've been a little too forward there..."
"Yuri is completely caught off guard and frantically fiddles with her hair as she figures out how to respond."
mc "Yeah... let's just sit down..."
y "O-okay...."
y "I think I know a good spot."
"Yuri leads me to the windowsill where we take our seats."

#Scene Transition

"Oddly enough, I find it enjoyable to be next to Yuri."
"Yeah, she might be a slow talker and have strange mannerisms..."
"But overall, she's pretty fun to be around."
"Derailing my train of thought, Yuri hands me the book as she peers over my shoulder to read the book."
mc "Do you feel better now?"
y "Yeah I do... I can't really see the book though..."
mc "Oh my bad."
"I try bringing the book closer to Yuri, but it makes makes my arm feel awkward."
y "Let me try something."
"Yuri pushes the book back towards me."
mc "Oh?"
"She then puts her head on my shoulder."
"I immediately feel the blood rush to my face as I'm filled with shock."
"Not that I mind Yuri doing that, but the fact that she actually did that astonishes me."
y "This isn't too distracting for you... right?"
mc "Oh no... not at all..."
mc "This is actually kinda nice..."
"Yuri looks off and blushes."
"She regains her composure and looks back at me."
y "Good... I was hoping you wouldn't find me weird for doing this."
mc "Maybe you should do it more."
"I say that teasingly."
"Yuri lets out a small giggle."
y "Well if you want me too...I will..."
mc "Noted."
"God, what am I saying?"
"With our banter aside, we pick up where we left off."
"The novel actually turns out to be fairly interesting."
"The novel starts off rather tame as it's mostly introducing the main character, this girl, Libitana, and her messed up life story."
"Turns out she was given away to this human experiment prison at a young age by her parents, who were desperately poor and couldn't afford to keep her."
"She spent most of her life at that prison, being subjected to a variety of unspeakable tests and tortures."
"Eventually, she had enough and decided to break free, but the problem for her now is that there are others who escaped the prison and are trying to hunt her down so they can do who knows what."
"I still haven't figured out who this ‘Markov' person is, or where this ‘portrait' comes into play yet, but I figure it'll be explained later."
"After reading the first few chapters we decide to take a break."
y "It's a good read, isn't it [player]?"
mc "Yeah! I'll admit it kinda started a bit slow for my tastes, but the story is pretty interesting so far!"
mc "I like it!"
mc "I'm really glad she got reunited for with her uncle and sister too, kind of a happy little twist in a rather morbid story."
y "Do you think Libitana will take the chance to repair her relationship with her family?"
mc "I mean, I hope she does. It seems like the right thing to do."
mc "Very rarely do people get a second chance to do the right thing."
mc "If I was her, I'd take it."
y "Y-yeah... me too..."
"We sit for the next moments in silence, unsure of what to do next."
"Yuri seems to be deep in thought, as if she's unsure of what to say next."
"She takes a deep breath and turns to face me again."
y "I'm really glad we get to spend time like this [player]."
mc "Yeah, me too!"
y "And...."
"Yuri hesitates."
mc "And what?"
y "Even though we haven't been able to really get to know each other..."
"I hear Yuri's voice break as she says that, but she continues to press on, sounding like she's trying to fight back tears."
y "Truth is, I haven't had real friend in years..."
y "Not since Middle School has anyone treated me like an actual person."
y "I've honestly almost forgotten what it was like to enjoy being in the company of someone who cares about you...."
"I feel my heart sink into my chest as she says that."
"Even though Yuri does spend most of her time in the cub by herself, it never occured to me that she was like that outside the club too."
y "And so... it means a lot to me that we get to spend time together..."
y "Truthfully... last Sunday was the most fun that I had with someone all year!"
mc "Honestly... same here."
mc "Before joining the club, I really didn't leave my house for anything other than school..."
y "Yeah... I can relate..."
y "I-I... just wish we could've had spent more time together...."
mc "Me too..."
mc "And you know, my offer still stands about us hanging out sometime...."
mc "If you're still interested that is..."
y "Oh...I wasn't sure you were still free....
y "I wouldn't want to ruin your plans with Sayori..."
y "...and... I'd hate to pull you away from Natsuki... if you're hanging out with her that is..."
"Right..."
"Speaking of Sayori..."
"I look up to see Sayori still looking off into space."
"Maybe I should go check up on her..."
y "It's just that..."
y "I've always been so alone..."
"Yuri dedjectly stares at the floor."
"Without thinking, I take Yuri's hand."
"Yuri looks up to me, her violet eyes being reflective in the sunlight and a smile slowly forming across her face."
mc "Yuri...."
mc "You don't have to be alone anymore."
"Yuri's face turns full crimson."
y "[player]... I...."
"Yuri squeezes my hand tightly."
"We struggle to make eye contact for longer than a few seconds but I try to muster up the courage to keep talking."
"But for some reason, I can't."
"We're just entranced intently looking at each other, both stammering as we try to find what we want to say to each other."
"I feel Yuri's gentle breaths brush against my face as she slowly leans into me."
"This feels...."
"Good..."
"But I really don't know what to do."
"Being like this with Yuri makes me wish to hold onto her and never let go."
"Still though..."
"I don't feel like this is right..."
"I'm with Sayori afterall, how would she react to seeing us like this?"
"I'm afraid that someone's gonna catch us and immediately get the wrong idea..."
"I glance around the room to see Natsuki rummaging around in the closet, Sayori still spacing out and Monika working on something."
"I turn back to face Yuri."
"Yuri looks whimsically into my eyes."
y "I... wouldn't mind spending more time with you [player]."
mc "Me neither, Yuri..."
"Yuri and I start to slowly lean into each other..."
